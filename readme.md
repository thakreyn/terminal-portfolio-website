# Terminal Portfolio Website

The terminal is something almost all programmers use. So it makes sense
to make a portfolio website that looks like a Terminal. 

The entire project is implemented
using basic web technologies (HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS) which is later hosted on Heroku.

Feel free to explore the website and its code!
